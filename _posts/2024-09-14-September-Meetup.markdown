The group met at Mile Zero Marine in Portsmouth VA. to chat as a group. After discussing the current issues with Bitcoin and answering any questions the meetup moved over to some festivities at Waterside Norfolk. The group enjoyed easy access to public transit ferry to take everyone across the river to the live music, food trucks, and drinks for a great evening. Looking forward to many more fun events with lots of discussion around the benefits and uses of Bitcoin.
