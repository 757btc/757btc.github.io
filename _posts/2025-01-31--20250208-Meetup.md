Please join us at 5:30pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and discuss all things Bitcoin & freedom tech. We will dive deeper into our previous discussion of [My First Bitcoin](https://myfirstbitcoin.io/). Our intention this time is to address self custody of Bitcoin and demonstrate how this works. We will also address current events, attendee questions and more. 

Some members are bringing food and drink to share. This is not required but much appreciated! We will be meeting at Mile Zero Marine, a small business in downtown Portsmouth run by a local Bitcoiner. Seating is limited, so if you have a camp chair it may be advisable to bring it.
