**Meetup July 12th 2025 - 6:00 PM at [Mile Zero Marine](https://milezeromarine.com/), 115 High Street Portsmouth, VA 23704**

The Bitcoin crew will be experiencing a local Bitcoin market earlier that day, reach out if you are interested. Because of the market, many of the members will meet at there earlier, but a few of the members will be around at the Mile Zero Marine Saturday July 12 evening for a Questions and Answers (QnA) session. If you have any questions or are just curious about Bitcoin and how it is beneficial to you and our community, swing by for a conversation and a demo.

The meetup will have plenty of hands on activities for everyone to try. Bring your curious friends and family members and lets build the Bitcoin community. Hope to see you all there!
