Inagural meeting was a huge success, we are looking to keep the momentum going for the second meetup. Please join us at 1:30pm for a meetup with 757BTC to discuss all things Bitcoin related. Meet and Greet will be followed by some Bitcoin discussion and Questions and Answers. We will discuss plans for Halving Party and future meetup schedules and plans. We will be meeting at a local business in downtown Portsmouth run by a local Bitcoiner.
