Join the Hampton Roads Bitcoiners in Portsmouth for great conversation and fellowship. The 757btc crew has deployed their 757btc app for all users and businesses in the 757. We will be demo'ing this service that our group is providing to the local community that includes:
 - basic lightning wallet
 - point of sale extension
 - LndHub extension to control your lightning wallet with the popular Blue wallet
 - Split payments extension which allows you to recieve lightning payments to a wallet and automatically split based on percentage to multiple lightning wallets
 - Boltz extension which allows you to move sats on and off of lightning to onchain utxo's
 - Nostr wallet connect (NWC) options to enable zaps to notes and other stuff transmitted by relays (NOSTR) apps
 - Pay Links extension which allows you to establish persistent lightning address or QR code for tips and lightning payments (This also will allow you to recieve zaps on NOSTR)

The meetup will have plenty of hands on activities for everyone to try. Bring your curious friends and family members and lets build the Bitcoin community. Hope to see you all there!
