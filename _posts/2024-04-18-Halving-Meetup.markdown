Please join us at 4:30pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC to celebrate the halving event and discuss all things bitcoin & freedom tech. Meet and Greet will feature food and drinks followed by some Bitcoin discussion and Questions and Answers.

Some members are bringing food and drink to share. This is not required but much appreciated! We will be meeting at a local business in downtown Portsmouth run by a local Bitcoiner.
