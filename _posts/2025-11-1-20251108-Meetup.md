The weather is starting to get cold and that can only mean one thing. Time to start generating some heat to stay comfy and warm inside for the fall and upcoming winter. What better way to generate that heat than with a home mining solution! Home miners are just as efficient as any electric space heater or electric coil type of heater except with a Bitcoin miner you also get some sats back for the work! Swing by MZM on Saturday the 8th at 2pm to see some examples of home mining solutions that you can use. Learn what it takes to mine Bitcoin and the benefits that Bitcoin mining brings.

Join the Hampton Roads Bitcoiners in Portsmouth for great conversation and fellowship. The meetup will have plenty of hands on activities for everyone to try. Example mining equipment will be demonstrated and discussed. Bring your curious friends and family members and lets build the Bitcoin community. Hope to see you all there!
