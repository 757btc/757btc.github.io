Please join us at 5:00pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC at Mile Zero Marine in Portsmouth VA. We plan to spend 60-90 minutes on meetup business, presentations and discussion, followed by an informal visit to a (TBD) restaurant on High St for beverages and snacks. Several members of the group are attending [Bitcoin 2024](https://bitcoin2024.b.tc/2024) in Nashville later this month, so this will be among the topics of discussion.
