Many of us like to think that the Bitcoin price is just a way to get the most out of our fiat by taking a little bit of fiat and converting it into Bitcoin where magically it increases it's buying power of fiat currency. You might not be able to use it to buy things or at least not like you can with US Dollars but at least you kind of get the picture that Bitcoin certainly can buy more dollars year over year than any other asset! The fact is that no one really knows what Bitcoin is because it's a massive monster of tools, developers, users and meme cowboys.

At 757BTC.org we are using Bitcoin every day and we share with each other ways that Bitcoin is changing our lives and the lives of many others on this planet. We not only cover Bitcoin but freedom, open source technology in general like the emerging technology of NOSTR where Bitcoin is being used as a reward system for the content that you enjoy!

Please join us at 5:00pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC at Mile Zero Marine in Portsmouth VA. We plan to spend 60-90 minutes on meetup business, presentations and discussion, followed by an informal visit to a (TBD) restaurant on High St for beverages and snacks. As always, we will discuss all the hot topics going on in Bitcoin. Questions and answer session will be ongoing, introducing anyone new to Bitcoin with demos!

 *Next Meetup November 9th 2024 - 5:00 PM at Mile Zero Marine*
