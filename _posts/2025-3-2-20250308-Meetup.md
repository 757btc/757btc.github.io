**Now is your chance to check them both out!**

Please join us at 5:30pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC and VB Bitcoin to celebrate our first joint meetup. We have been growing the Bitcoin community in Hampton Roads simulaneously for about a year now and we are stronger when we work together. 

We will be discussing the mission of each of our groups, our objectives, and ways we can help grow and educate the Bitcoin community of Hampton Roads.

Afterwards there will be plenty of time to break off into groups to discuss and provide education on various topics related to Bitcoin.

The meetup will take place in the reserved downstairs area of Pixels Pints and Bytes. This is a very family friendly environment with good food, good brews, mixed drinks, and tons of retro arcades for the kids.
