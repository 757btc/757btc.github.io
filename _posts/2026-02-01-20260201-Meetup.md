**Meetup February 14th 2026 - 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM at [Mile Zero Marine](https://milezeromarine.com/), 115 High Street Portsmouth, VA 23704**

--- 
Please join us at 2:00pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC discuss an upcoming Virginia meetup groups summit. The team will make sure we align on talking points and discuss what we hope to get out of the summit. There will also be discussion on parts, materials, and plans for an upcoming community Bitcoin Live Action Role Play (LARP). BTC++ has put together an open source plan for community groups to run a Bitcoin network where each of the operating components are people! If you are wondering how the Bitcoin network works, there is no better way than actually being part of it physically.

Although it will be Valentines day, we hope the early meetup time will facilitate a quick group meetup before we take our significant others out on dates. We will be meeting at Mile Zero Marine, a small business in downtown Portsmouth run by a local Bitcoiner. Seating is limited, so if you have a camp chair it may be advisable to bring it.
