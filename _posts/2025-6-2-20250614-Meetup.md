Join the Hampton Roads Bitcoiners in Portsmouth for great conversation and fellowship. There has been a lot of questions on Ecash. Join us for a high level discussion on how you can use custodial Bitcoin lightning in a private way and the risks associated with it.

The meetup will have plenty of hands on activities for everyone to try. Bring your curious friends and family members and lets build the Bitcoin community. Hope to see you all there!
