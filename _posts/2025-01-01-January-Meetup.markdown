Please join us at 5:00pm for a family friendly meetup with 757BTC to ring in the new year and discuss all things bitcoin & freedom tech. We will continue our presentation and discussion of [My First Bitcoin](https://myfirstbitcoin.io/) as well as addressing current events, attendee questions and more.

Some members are bringing food and drink to share. This is not required but much appreciated! We will be meeting at Mile Zero Marine, a small business in downtown Portsmouth run by a local Bitcoiner. Seating is limited, so if you have a camp chair it may be advisable to bring it.
