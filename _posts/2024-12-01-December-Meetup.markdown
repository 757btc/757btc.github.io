Ho Ho Ho and Happy Holidays! This time of year is getting colder but Bitcoin is heating up the atmosphere with sobering numbers of HODLers[^1] increasing their net worth by simply stacking sats.[^2] Are you stacking sats, too?  Why not? There is no better time than the present to get into Bitcoin and start dollar cost averaging yourself out of debt!

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is pretty simple. You take a small percentage of your fiat[^3] dollars from your paycheck, tips or retirement and purchase a small amount of Bitcoin. There are many ways to do this.  One such method is by using CashApp[^4], Strike[^5] or Fold[^6] apps to automatically purchase an amount hourly, daily, weekly or monthly. By purchasing the same dollar amount each time you can see how the value of the bitcoin increases over time. Reach out to one of us at the next meetup and we can help you get started.

The most important thing about Bitcoin is to get off of ZERO. Zero means that you have no Bitcoin. There are Billionaires and Millionaires who have no Bitcoin. They are very smart. They are financially savvy but they do not understand that all of their dollars can be devalued, confiscated or they can get de-banked just by politically aligning with the wrong people at the wrong time.

Some wealthy people do understand money but they are hesitant to accept Bitcoin because it is technology that is electronic. Instead they are buying gold or silver. This is good except that you need to carry around the coins or bars to use them and the precious metals need to be verified. Confiscation is another risk. Even in the United States gold was confiscated in 1933 by an executive order [^7]. That is less than 100 years ago. Bitcoin solves that problem by allowing anyone to keep their secret keys in a text form offline and the Bitcoin network online just carries the ledger of transactions. As Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous only the public keys and addresses are identified. Through careful management of your Bitcoin you can use the network without disclosing who you are.

Obviously if you are using your bank account to purchase Bitcoin you are identifying yourself. This is where we come in as a group and we teach you how to not only get beyond zero but to protect your 1st Amendment and 2nd Amendment rights to say what you want to say and to defend yourself. Bitcoin is both free speech and a weapon to protect yourself and your family.

Christmas is upon us, Hanukkah is also starting on the 25th of December this year. It's a great time to get together with family and friends. Maybe you don't celebrate either holiday. It doesn't matter to us what you believe in. What matters to us is that you want to help yourself and your family escape debt slavery. We all want this. At 757BTC.org we have gathered together to share our stories, experiences and achievements. We have a wide variety of culture, education and skill. Come join us for this winter month of December and  share with us your experience as well. Even if you have never owned any Bitcoin we will help you to understand how it works, what it does and how to get off of Zero.

At 757BTC.org we meet every 2nd Saturday of the month. Our next meetup is at Pixels, Pints and Bytes on Decemebr 14, 2024 at 5:30 PM. Come out and join us plebs[^8] as we discuss the world of Bitcoin, NOSTR[^9] and freedom technology.

## Footnotes ##

[^1]: **HODL** - Hold On for Dear Life. These are the people who are not in Bitcoin just to get more dollars. These are the people who are holding on to the savings and no matter what are not selling.

[^2]: **Sats** - are a term you will hear a lot in Bitcoin circles.  1 Bitcoin contains 100,000,000 Sats.  The term Sat is short for Satoshi. Satoshi Nakamoto is the mysterious founder of the Bitcoin White Paper and Bitcoin. Decimal wise 1 Satoshi is 8 digits behind the decimal point in Bitcoin like this 0.00000001

[^3]: **Fiat** is the short term used for "Fiat Currency" which is a money that has been declared by a king or government. It is also a currency that is not backed by anything other than the declaration that it is money. As of 1971 the US Dollar was formerly backed by gold but it is now a pure fiat currency.  [Nixon Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock)

[^4]: **Cash App** -- Cash App allows you to connect your bank account and send and receive Bitcoin or Dollars. You can also Dollar Cost Average. With Cash App once you stack 50,000 sats or more you can send them to your cold storage for free since they pay for the fees on chain. Cash App is a good tool to have when you are starting out in Bitcoin.  [Get Cash App](https://cash.app/app/WQ8MF7F)

[^5]: **Strike** -- Strike is another app that allows you to connect your banking and purchase small amounts or large amounts of Bitcoin. You have the ability to use the lightning network as well and you get a very nice lightning address to accept Bitcoin from others.Strike also allows you to send Bitcoin to your cold storage for free allowing you to stack larger sums for future use. You can dollar cost average as well.  [Get Strike](https://invite.strike.me/BVYH9F)

[^6]: **Fold** -- Fold is another app that allows you to Dollar Cost Average Bitcoin. Like Strike or Cash App there are other bells and whistles. Fold allows you also to earn Bitcoin by using the debit card. You can even push Bitcoin to you debit card to use it if you are in a jam. [Get Fold](https://use.foldapp.com/r/RM8F5LJV)

[^7]: **Executive Order 6102** -- "Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt "forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States." The executive order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act in March 1933." --[Executive Order 6102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102)

[^8]: **Plebs**, short for plebeians, are ordinary people. As no one is extraordinary in Bitcoin. We just try to be normal humans with the machinations of convoluted money. [Plebians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeians)

[^9]: **NOSTR** -- Notes and other stuff transmitted by relays -- [nostr.org](https://nostr.org/)
