Join the Hampton Roads Bitcoiners in Portsmouth for great conversation and fellowship. The 757btc team had a great time last month going over the value of freedom of speech and how it relates to code is speech with Bitcoin. The team will review this core concept as well as begin to discuss ofther core concepts such as cryptography and what is money.

This meetup will focus on the security of the Bitcoin network and how we can better understand critical scenarios that can lead to forks in the main chain. Cryptography basics will be presented, best practices you should consider while holding and interacting with Bitcoin, and some of the latest research that is focused on identifying critical scenarios that lead to forks within the Bitcoin network.

The meetup will have plenty of hands on activities for everyone to try. Bring your curious friends and family members and lets build the Bitcoin community. Hope to see you all there!
